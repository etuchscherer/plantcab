# Plantcab

Software for running my plant cabinet. Consists of a server that interacts with the raspberry pi gpio, and a front end utility, called useless-bay, and various other tools to help support these applications. 

## Useless-Bay

Typescript and svelte frontend for the Plantcab touchscreen. See more here :: (TODO: Add link).

## API

The node express server. This server powers the api that interacts with the physical gpio board.
